## Objective 1: Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts

<details><summary>Explain What IaC is?</summary>
<p>

Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of our data center to be versioned and treated as we would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used. 
</p>
<p>
IaC makes it easy to provision and apply infrastructure configurations, saving time. It standardizes workflows across different infrastructure providers (e.g., VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) by using a common syntax across all of them.
</p>
<p>It is infrastructure (CPUs, memory, disk, firewalls, etc.) defined as code within definition files.
</p>
</details>


<details><summary>Describe advantages of IaC patterns?</summary>

- **Can be applied throughout the infrastructure lifecycle**
  - Day 0 : Initial Build 
  - Day 1 : OS and application config you apply after the initial build. Includes OS updates, patches, app config. 
- **Saves time by making it easy to provision and apply infrastructure configuration.** Workflow is **standardized** across providers wether its VMWare, AWS, Azure, or GCP. 
- **It's easy to understand** the intent of infrastructure changes. 
- **Iac makes changes idempotent**:
  - The result will always be the same since the same code is being applied 
- **Iac makes changes consistent**:
  -  The manual work is removed with Iac no more need for system administrators to remotely connect to each machine by executing a series of commands or scripts which can cause inconsistencies based on who executes it
- **Iac makes changes predictable**:
  - code can be tested before applying it to production so results are always predictable 
- **Iac allows for mutation in previously defined configurations, making for a more manageable system**

#### Objective 2: Understand Terraform's purpose (vs other IaC)

<details><summary>Explain multi-cloud and provider-agnostic benefits</summary>
<p>
Multi-cloud deployment increases fault tolerance. This means in the event of failure there is a more graceful recovery of a region or provider. 
</p>
<p>
The benefits of being provider-agnostic means there can be a single configuration that manages many providers.
</p>
</details>


<details><summary>Explain the benefits of state</summary>
  
- **Mapping to the Real World** 
  - Terraform requires a database to map Tf(Terraform) config to the real world. 
  ex. With state mapping Tf knows resource `resource "aws_instance" "foo"`  represents instance `i-abcd34233`. 
- **Metadata**
  - Tf tracks metadata or resource dependencies 
  - Tf keeps a copy of the most recent set of dependencies in state. So that correct order of operations can be executed even if an item is deleted from the configuration. 
- **Performance** 
  - besides basic mapping Tf also keeps a cache of attribute values for all resources in the state. 
  - most optional feature of state, only used to improve performance. 
  - small infra: for plan and apply Tf syncs all resources in state 
  - large infra: cache state is used because of API rate limits and querying all resources is too slow. Large infra also make use of `-refresh=false` and `-target` flags
- **Syncing** 
  - default syncing Tf stores state in a file in the current working directory
  - for teams remote state is used, remote locking is utilized to avoid multiple people running Tf at the same time.

<details><summary>IaC with Terraform</summary>

<p>

At a high level, Terraform allows operators to use HCL to author files containing definitions of their desired resources on almost any provider (AWS, GCP, GitHub, Docker, [etc](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html)) and automates the creation of those resources at the time of apply.
</p>

- **Workflows** 
  - Scope: Establish resources that need to be created for the project 
  - Author: Create the configuration based on the scoped parameters with HCL
  - Initialize: run `terraform init`  to download the provider plug-ins for the project
  - Plan & Apply: run `terraform plan` to verify creation then `terraform apply` to create the resources and state files 
- **Advantages of Terraform**
  - Platform Agnostic: allows for management of a mixed environment with the same workflow
  - State Management: State files are created when a project is initialized. state is used to create plans and update our infrastructure. State determines how configuration changes are measured. When a change is made, those changes are compared with the state file to determine resource creation or changes  
  - Operator Confidence: `terraform apply` allows for review before changes are applied.
